# [How to create 3D map data?](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/home#how-to-create-3d-map-data)

First, you try creating small-scale 3D map data for private area testing, using the NDT mapping node provided by Autoware or using the [Autoware Tools](https://tools.tier4.jp/) (paid service). 

Once it goes well, you can contact a professional mapping company in your region to create large-scale 3D map data for public road testing. 
- Examples of the mapping companies include [Aisan Technology](http://www.aisantec.co.jp/english/) and [Mandli](https://www.mandli.com/). 

- Note that the NDT mapping node and the Autoware Tools are designed for closed environments, thus not suitable for creating large-scale 3D map data.
